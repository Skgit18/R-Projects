# R-Projects: Climate, Weather, and Beyond

This is a collection of mini-projects showcasing my skills in R. They focus on data analysis, handling climate and weather data, and data visualization. Some of these projects are based on assignments from online courses on Coursera, while some are just random ideas. Each project is written in R Markdown and involves exploring real-world datasets, trying different R packages and functions, and visualizing the results.
