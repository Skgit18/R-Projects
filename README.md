### **R Data Science Projects: Climate, Weather, and Beyond**

This is a collection of mini-projects showcasing my skills in R. They focus on data analysis, handling climate and weather data, and data visualization. Each project demonstrates the application of R Markdown, interactive plots, and various statistical techniques to explore the real world. Each project is based on a random idea. It involves exploring real-world datasets, trying different R packages and functions, and visualizing the results.
