# R-Projects
### **R Data Science Projects: Climate, Weather, and Beyond**

This is a collection of mini-projects showcasing my skills in R. They focus on data analysis, handling climate and weather data, and data visualization. Each project demonstrates the application of R Markdown, interactive plots, and various statistical techniques to explore the real world. Some of these projects are based on assignments from online courses on Coursera, while some are just random ideas. They involve exploring real-world datasets, trying different R packages and functions, and visualizing the results.
